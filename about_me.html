                       alt="Nancy Vedder-Shults" /> My work is rooted in ritual, story and song as well as in feminist thealogy and women's studies
                  scholarship. As a Ph.D., I honed my skills in the emerging field of Women's Studies in the 1970s
                  and 1980s, evolving an empowering leadership and teaching style that I use in my retreats and
                  workshops today. I believe that my ongoing research in divination and myth is accessible and
                  inviting. (And that my workshops are playful and fun!)
                  <br>

                  <br> I've offered personal growth workshops since 1987. In 1992, I left the Women's Studies Program
                  at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to work full-time as a singer, storyteller, educator,
                  workshop facilitator and ritualist. Since then I've presented workshops and sung all over North
                  America, as well as writing
                  <a href="oracle.html">
                        <b>The World is Your Oracle.</b>
                  </a>
                  My approach is both creative and intellectual, using the skills that created my recording
                  <b>Chants for the Queen of Heaven
                  </b> as well as those that led to my Ph.D.
                  <br>

                  <br> My efforts recently received recognition when I was named a Wisdom Keeper of the Goddess Spirituality
                  Movement, and in the form of a Feminist Theology Award from the Unitarian Universalist Women's
                  Federation.
                  <br>

                  <br> I live in Madison, WI, with a feminist spouse. My self-empowered, thirty-something daughter
                  created the beautiful illustrations for
                  <b>The World is Your Oracle</b>.
