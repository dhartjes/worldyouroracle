          <p>Welcome to
            <i>The World is Your Oracle</i> with Nancy Vedder-Shults. I’m a writer, speaker, and workshop facilitator.
            Most importantly, I’m a woman who empowers others to empower themselves.</p>
          <p>My work enables people to tap into their deepest knowing, so they can live the biggest, most vital, most
            loving lives possible. When I listen to the participants in my workshops and classes share their truths,
            I’m amazed at their intuition. They know who they are and what they want. Working with me, they make
            breakthroughs, find their passion, and begin to glow from the inside out. What they find is practical
            spiritual wisdom to realize their purpose in life.</p>
          <p>
            Personal development is important to all of us. We all want to become the most fully realized version of ourselves,
            in touch with our spirituality and creating the world we want to live in. We want to reach our full
            potential and live out our own truths. And we want to do it with less stress in our lives, greater
            confidence in our choices, and more love!</p>

              Learning to tap into your inner wisdom and discovering how to navigate the path ahead is a mystical practice rooted
              in surprisingly practical techniques. My new book
              <a href="oracle.html"><cite>The World is Your Oracle</cite></a> contains 40 different methods that
              I teach in my workshops.
            </p>

            <p>
              The chaos of life today keeps us ungrounded and out of touch with our own reality.
            </p>

            <p>
              That’s where
              <a href="oracle.html"><cite>The World is Your Oracle</cite></a> comes in. The divination techniques
              in this book awaken you to your own wise guidance. Tune in, look inside, and hear your still, small
              voice.

        <p>
          Participants in my workshops and classes access their deep wisdom in transformative ways. They have plunged head
          first into the realm of inspiration, finding pragmatic answers and creative solutions to problems and
          challenges that may have been stumping them for years. And sometimes, it has been pure magic.
