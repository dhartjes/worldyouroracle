      </b>

      Since 1993, I've traveled all over North America, facilitating workshops and retreats, delivering keynotes,
      creating worship services and singing. In the first year alone I flew to Southern California, Oklahoma, North
      Carolina, Saskatchewan, Canada, Michigan, Missouri and many cities in the Upper Midwest. Since then I've
      flown all over the US, from north to south and from east to west.
      <br>

      <br>I'll walk more than a mile and fly many hundreds to create learning experiences that allow people to take the
      next step in their personal growth. I've performed weddings and memorial services, worked with children, led many
      worship services and rituals.

      <br>I work a great deal within my religous home of Unitarian Universalism, but I've also presented workshops for
      people in earth-centered traditions, for Religious Scientists, for Unity Church and for interfaith groups. My
      ecofeminism speaks to many people. What I have to say resonates with the many seekers of today.
