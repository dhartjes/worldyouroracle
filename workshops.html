      </b>

      Since 1993, I've traveled all over North America, facilitating workshops and retreats, delivering keynotes,
      creating worship services and singing. In the first year alone I flew to Southern California, Oklahoma, North
      Carolina, Saskatchewan, Canada, Michigan, Missouri and many cities in the Upper Midwest. Since then I've
      flown all over the US, from north to south and from east to west.
      <br>

      <br> I guess I'm a born teacher and performer, because I'll walk more than a mile and fly many hundreds to create
      learning experiences that include music, movement, and the kind of work and play that allows people to take
      the next step in their personal growth. I've performed weddings and memorial services, worked with children,
      led many worship services and rituals, and everywhere I go, I sing my music. I work a great deal with Unitarian
      Universalists, since that's my religious home, but I've also presented workshops for people in earth-centered
      traditions, for Religious Scientists, for Unity Church and for interfaith groups. My ecofeminism speaks to
      many people. What I have to say seems to resonate with seekers, and there are a lot of us today.

      </div>

      <p>
        <h3 class="smallheadline1">The World is Your Oracle</h3>
        Divination allows you to discover your inner wisdom and connect with its counsel. From Nancy's new book of the
        same name.
      </p>


      <div>
        <img class="pull-right img-300"
             alt="Dreams"
             src="images/dreams.jpg">
      </div>

      <p>
        <h3 class="smallheadline1">Mythic Modes</h3>
        Utilizing intellectual, physical, creative and ritual modes, make the sacred stories that undergird your life visible
        while connecting consciously with your deepest concerns and your truest self.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3 class="smallheadline1">Dream Wisdom</h3>
        Beginning with a dream incubation, we interpret dreams with role-playing, dialoging, ritual, Gestalt, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3 class="smallheadline1">Invoking the Fire Dragon</h3>
        Invoke the fire dragon and usher eros into your life, infusing yourself with the playful energy that is the source
        for ecstatic movement, sensuality and pleasure.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3 class="smallheadline1">Reclaiming Our Stories, Reclaiming Ourselves</h3>
        Empower your story through personal mythmaking and multicultural tales. While the hero's quest is validated in
        our culture, other stories are trivialized. We need the wisdom of each person's life history.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3 class="smallheadline1">Honoring Each Other, Honoring Ourselves</h3>
        An anti-racism workshop focusing on intercultural understanding, discovering our deep connections and celebrating
        our diversity.

      <p>
        <h3 class="smallheadline1">In the Beginning: Goddess Mythology in Story and Song</h3>
        An interactive lecture honoring goddesses from several traditions. We've come to know why women need the Goddess;
        Nancy demonstrates how important She can be for men as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3 class="smallheadline1">Balancing Dark & Light</h3>
        Look inward for your own fertile darkness and the light which illuminates it. The dark is shunned in our culture,
        but dark earth energies are at the core of all creativity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3 class="smallheadline1">Crone and Sage</h3>
        Explore the wisdom of aging, the power to let go, the power of endings and the power of death and rebirth.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3 class="smallheadline1">A Council of All Beings</h3>
        In this communal ritual, we set aside our human identity in order to speak on behalf of other life-forms on our
        beautiful, but threatened earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3 class="smallheadline1">Seasonal Rituals</h3>
        Nancy creates rituals and worship services to honor the cycles of earth's seasons.
      </p>
