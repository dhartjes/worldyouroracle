      <p>
        Fair Winds Press published my book
        <i><a href="oracle.html">The World is Your Oracle: Divinatory Practices for Tapping Your Inner Wisdom
            and Getting the Answers You Need</a></i> in April, 2017. I’m excited to share it.
      </p>

            The goal of
            <i><a href="oracle.html">The World is Your Oracle</a></i> is to bring the joys and wisdom of divination
            into our daily lives… and trusting the answers we receive so that we may create happy, fulfilled,
            purposeful
            lives

      <p>
        I wrote this book because I know everyone has burning questions. Everyone wants to find the answers. And
        everyone
        needs to know their own truth.
        <i><a href="oracle.html">The World is Your Oracle</a></i> enables seekers to do just that: craft their own
        questions, delve into their inner wisdom, and find the answers they need. It’s a multiple-technique approach
        designed for each individual's distinctive experiences and desires.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of a single oracular system,
        <i><a href="oracle.html">The World is Your Oracle</a></i> gathers together 40 divinatory practices from around
        the world. When doing a reading, you’re not selecting a pre-programmed answer, like with tarot cards or
        runes. Rather you experience a particular method of "finding" what you seek. The book assembles multicultural,
        multireligious techniques that range from ancient oracles to my own contemporary innovations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beginners will find many straightforward ways of connecting with their inner wisdom in
        <i><a href="oracle.html">The World is Your Oracle</a></i> – methods as simple as
        <ul class="offset-md-1">
          <li>sculpting clay</li>
          <li>noticing a creature while walking in nature</li>
          <li>or simply overhearing a conversation</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Those already practiced in divination may discover many new oracles that expand their intuitive skills. These
        open-ended
        techniques include
        <ul class="offset-md-1">
          <li>listening to rustling leaves</li>
          <li>watching the movements of an object blown by the wind</li>
          <li>or dancing ecstatically</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Together
        <i><a href="oracle.html">The World is Your Oracle</a></i> offers you many new ways of asking, answering, and
        understanding.
