              <strong>The World is Your Oracle</strong> is a compilation of divination techniques from
              around the world – both ancient and contemporary – designed for each individual’s unique
              situation, desire, and intuitive style. It gathers together dozens of methods, one-third of
              them visual, one-third auditory, and one-third kinesthetic. You can select a technique
              based on what appeals to you in the moment, one that dovetails with your intuitive strength
              (visual, auditory, or kinesthetic), or simply work your way through them for fun and
              greater self-knowledge.
            </p>

            <h2>Examples of divination techniques include;</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>Get guidance from the wild as you notice which what animal crosses your path</li>
              <li>Prime yourself to dream about your question and awaken to a solution</li>
              <li>Enter the wisdom of the spirit world by calling upon your guides and ancestors</li>
              <li>Tap into your body’s hidden wisdom to get insight and answers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>CONNECT with your INNER WISDOM
              <br /> And RECEIVE the GUIDANCE you NEED</h3>

            <p>
              <b>Life today is full of noise.</b> We’re all bombarded by advertising messages, expert
              advice, campaign promises, and opinions of every sort. Sometimes it’s hard to hear yourself
              think.
            </p>

            <p>
              Listening to what <b>Steve Jobs</b> called "the whisperings" of intuition helps you to make
              successful decisions for your highest good and embrace the change involved in self-growth.
            </p>

            <p>The oracular techniques in <i>The World Is Your Oracle</i> will quiet the clamor in your
              head, so you can:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>hear those "whisperings" from your inner wisdom</li>
              <li>see with your second sight, and</li>
              <li>connect with your body wisdom.</li>

            <h3>EVERYONE has QUESTIONS</h3>

            <p>
              Everyone wants answers to their burning questions. And everyone needs find their inner
              truth
              to find their life's purpose. But not everyone discovers this truth in the same way.

            <h3>ENERGIZE your INTUITION like the great ARTISTS, SCIENTISTS, and ENTREPENEURS of yesterday
              and today
            </h3>

            <p>
              From ancient Greeks to modern-day North Americans, people all over the globe have gained
              insight into their many questions by using oracles. That’s because divination can help you
              set priorities, meet challenges, and find creative solutions to your problems.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today we’re living in an environment of rapid change, where analytical thinking no longer
              suffices. As a result, in the last few years, a growing number of seekers have been
              turning to divination for spiritual sustenance. Even top executives have
              identified"creative
              insights" (i.e. oracles) as the best way forward in today’s market.

            <h3>DISCOVER your INNATE ABILITY to KNOW</h3>

            <p>
              Other types of divination offer generic feedback. The Magician in tarot means will power or
              mastery. The rune Mannaz means humankind or the self. Each throw of the I Ching has a
              definite interpretation.
            </p>

            <p>
              The oracles in this book show you how to channel your own abilities and tune into the
              messages surrounding you for specific guidance to your most pressing issues. Your
              receptivity to the truths buried in your unconscious unlocks these divinations. <i>The
                World is Your Oracle</i> encourages spiritual development by connecting you to your
              deepest wisdom, regardless of your personal spirituality. Once you begin to put oracular
              insights into practice, you're on the path to authentic personal growth.

                  If you tend to be visually oriented, techniques like scrying, dream incubation, or

            <h3>ORACLES spark "AHA MOMENTS"</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Science is finally catching up with the wisdom traditions of the world. We now know
                that divination acts to facilitate "aha moments," creative insights that seem to come
                to us spontaneously.
                <br />
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                Studies have shown that flashes of insight occur when a person’s brain is in a
                particular state. This is exactly the frame of mind that divination facilitates – an
                altered state that seers and sages have known about for millenia.

            <h3>40 Techniques to Choose from</h3>

            <p>
              <i>The World is Your Oracle</i> provides historical and personal context and clear,
              step-by-step instructions for each of its 40 different oracular methods. Together they
              offer many new ways of asking, answering, and understanding.
            </p>

            <p>
              And you don’t have to go far. Oracles are part of the natural world that surrounds us.
              You can:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Listen to birdsong and not what it suggests</li>
              <li>Open a book at random and read what's written there</li>
              <li>Let repeated cues and coincidences clue you into a new perspective</li>
              <li>Take a Zen Concentration Walk to mindfully reflect on the issue at hand</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>INCREASE your CREATIVITY and IMPROVE Your Day-to-Day Life</h3>

            <p>
              Oracles put you in touch with yourself. They let you discover your motivations, feelings,
              and thoughts about any question you’re exploring.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can set priorities, embrace self-growth and change, and find creative solutions to your
              problems through a regular practice of tapping into your intuition. At times, oracles can
              even point to an outworn habit that you need to discard, or encourage you to take a risk
              that you might have been too timid to tackle on your own.
            </p>

            <p>
              But most importantly, they can help you to stay happy and healthy in your daily life. You
              can tap into your inner knowing whenever you need it.
