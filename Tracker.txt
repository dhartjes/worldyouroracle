12/6/2002 Here's the scoop to date:



Just billed all the below at $120 (5 hours X $24/hour).

12/16 I worked 1 hours on file compressions & calendar update.

12/9    I worked 0.5 hours on file compressions, bio page upload for client check, calendar update, email explaining options (also changed "street" to "court" but on my time).

12/6    I worked 2 hours on eddress & street address updates & creating and uploading a sermon page, with changes and added link to the writings page as a result of this inclusion. I also activated some links that weren't, and tweaked the consistency of the links system (all but namesake pages should have all links active; Per had inactivated those links on the "sub-pages" (like the "Writings" link inactive on the Delphyne story page because Delphyne is a as a subpage of Writings; this makes sense from an ontological perspective, but not from the user's perspective, especially when they enter the site from something other than a home page).



Nancy gave me a check in May/June 2002 for $36 (1.5 hours), which I have not yet cashed. Need to talk with her about 3 hrs ($72) and billing, esp. into 2003.



Here's original blurb from Nancy about account access:



    First before I forget it, here is the info you will need to help me 

maintain my site.  My server is cedant.com.  My domain name is 

www.mamasminstrel.net.  My username is mamasm.  My password is earthma.  I 

don't know what an FTP log-in or address is.  The IP Address is 

65.108.125.242.  To look at administration of the site it's 

www.mamasminstrel.net/menu.  I hope that is all the information you need.  

But if that doesn't cover the FTP log-in, let me know.



To access her hosting account: mamasminstrel.net/menu (no www)

Greetings.

This is a reminder that the password
you're currently using for your hosting account with ourselves - mama1669 will
not be fully compatible with our servers after the PHP/MySQL upgrade being
carried out on Sunday 13th Sept. It is therefore essential that you change your
password before the upgrade. To do this, please log into the control panel for
your account as normal and you will be prompted to change the account password.
You can log into the control panel for your account by going to
https://chica.visn.co.uk/cpanel/ with the username of mama1669

If you've
forgotten your password for your control panel and FTP, please use the reset
password option by going to https://chica.visn.co.uk/cpanel/. When prompted
for
a username and password, click 'Reset password'. You should then see a page
containing a reset password feature. The username you need to enter is
mama1669

An email will be sent to the contact address listed in our records
containing a link which when clicked, will inform you of your new
password.

Hi Per --

I found someone who can do the minor changes I need done to my website (my nephew's brother-in-law Dominic Hartjes).  He wants to know a few technical things that would help him get started, such as where the code resides, who hosts it, and what languages it is currently written in. I can tell him who hosts the website -- It's  Vision Internet Limited <info@visn.co.uk> -- but the code and language questions are beyond me.  If you "reply all," Dominic will get your answers, too.

I hope you are doing well.  My exciting news is that I now have a literary agent.  Yay!!! I will be signing the contract tomorrow (and that happened despite my out-of-date website).  But going forward with publishers, I need to update the website.

Love to you out in Oregonland,
Nancy

Hi Nancy

Good to hear you found someone!

 It's written in old fashioned and simple HTML. The host should be able to answer any other questions.

Be well,
Per

Hello Nancy and Per,

I had a little difficulty connecting to the site using the host name and credentials below. I was wondering if we could double check this information and make sure it is current. 

Host: Vision Internet Limited <info@visn.co.uk>.
Hostname: thorin.visn.co.uk
login name: mama1669
password: t7hLeVav


My other theory is that Vision Internet Limited may have moved your application to another machine. I was able to determine that the hostname may actually be chica.visn.co.uk at this point. If this information is up-to-date, we may need to contact the host to determine what if anything has changed.

Thanks,
Dominic

to me, Nancy 
Yes, I think it's best to contact the host.

Nancy, 

There is also a password reset function that I was able to find, but I wanted to check with you first before doing that. Two questions first: are you OK with that, and do you know what email address you used to sign up with Vision Limited Internet?

Thanks,
Dominic

Hi Dominic --

Yes, go ahead and reset the password if you need to.  I used mcsnvs@aol.com to sign up with Vision Limited. And I don't use that email anymore, so they probably told me all about the changes and I never saw it.  Hope this works.

Thanks,
Nancy

Hey Nancy,

Are you able to access that email account still? There should be an email there now with a confirmation code and a link that will allow you to reset your password. Could you either send me the code or click the link to reset your password? 

Thanks,
Dominic

Great Dominic!  Keep me posted on the hours.  Tuesday for the photos is fine.  I think it would be best if I paid you when you're finished with both jobs.  

I had dinner with Ech, Madee, Micah, Barbara and Luciano tonight.  It was fun.  And the dessert Madee made was amazingly delicious.  She's quite the cook.

Thanks,
Nancy
