      <h1 class="page-title">Named a Wisdom Keeper of the
        <br>Goddess Spirituality Movement
        <br>for my Music</h1>

      <p>
        In 2013 my CD Chants for the Queen of Heaven earned kudos for me when I was named a “Wisdom Keeper of the Goddess
        Spirituality Movement" by SageWoman Magazine. I’ve always loved music, and I sing whenever I can, even
        in answer to questions. But by the mid-1980s I had discovered that I was a minstrel for the Queen of Heaven
        and Earth. Singing Her praises sets me free, as the lyrics to one of my chants asserts. When I'm inspired,
        Gaia flows through me in song. My recordings are thank offerings to the goddesses who have sparked my creativity.
        I hope they inspire you as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Performing live energizes me. My most exciting performance was for an audience of 1,500 people at the Spokane Opera
        House during the General Assembly of the Unitarian Universalist Association in 1996. But smaller concerts,
        since they are more intimate, offer their own satisfactions. Opening for Libana, one of my favorite singing
        groups, felt like a perfect fit, and adding my voice to a lecture by Starhawk gratified me deeply. Singing
        is my lifeblood. Whether it's spontaneous improvisation or songs I've composed, music lifts my soul.

        Its music speaks directly to the heart, ranging from a celebratory Renaissance procession (with English horn, flute,
        cello and a variety of percussion) to meditative Eastern incantations accompanied by Tibetan bell; from
        the driving polyrhythms of an Afro-Cuban chant to the tranquil Shakuhachi flute of a Japanese song; from
        Nancy's simple, but haunting modal melodies to the complex harmonies of many of her arrangements; from
        the bubbling passion of "Volcano Woman," a chant to Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess, to the contemplative
        sounds of "Kwan Zeon Bosai," dedicated to the Korean goddess of compassion.

        <p>
          <b>Singing the Promise</b>, a live recording of earth-centered music, gathers four diverse recording artists
          on one CD: Carole Eagleheart, Khrysso, Mary Grigolia and Nancy Vedder-Shults. Each musician brings a
          different perspective to their songs: Khrysso, his background in folklore; Mary, her open-hearted ministry;
          Carole, her teaching in the Seneca Wolf Clan; and Nancy, her love of ritual and story.
        </p>

        <p>
          The music on this CD is celebratory, moving, and spirited, running the gamut from simple chant to powerful hymns
          in honor of the earth. Nancy's songs, never recorded before, include: Hymn to the Earth, Changing Woman,
          Spirits, My Help is In the Mountain and Green God.
